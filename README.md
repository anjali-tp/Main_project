                                E-District Grievance Management
                The *e-District portal project for Pattambi Taluk* is designed to make filing and resolving complaints about government services simple and efficient. 
                Citizens can submit complaints through the online portal, providing details about their issues along with various supporting methods, such as uploading
                images, videos, or documents, to clearly explain their concerns. The portal allows users to track the status of their complaints in real time, ensuring 
                they are updated at every stage. To promote accountability, unresolved complaints are automatically forwarded to higher authorities for timely resolution.
                For individuals with limited internet access or digital literacy, *Common Service Centers (CSCs)* are established in rural and remote areas to provide 
                assistance. The system integrates with government departments to streamline communication and ensure faster resolutions. By offering multiple ways to 
                file complaints and focusing on transparency, this project ensures that every resident in Pattambi Taluk can easily raise their concerns and receive
                timely solutions.
